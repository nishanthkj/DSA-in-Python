#### **Data Structures**
- **Definition:** Data Structures are ways to organize and store data in a computer to perform tasks efficiently.
- **Purpose:** Data structures are used to manage and manipulate data in ways that optimize specific operations like searching, insertion, deletion, and sorting.

#### **Types of Data Structures:**

1. **Primitive Data Structures**
   - **Integer:** Whole numbers without decimal points (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 1000).
   - **Float:** Numbers with decimal points (e.g., 3.5, 6.7, 20.2).
   - **Character:** Single characters (e.g., 'A', 'B', 'C').
   - **String:** Sequence of characters (e.g., "Hello", "Data Structure").
   - **Boolean:** Logical values (TRUE or FALSE).

2. **Non-Primitive Data Structures**
   - **Linear:** Data elements are arranged in a sequential manner.
     - **Array**: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
     - **Linked List**: A linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next.
     - **Stack**: Follows LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
     - **Queue**: Follows FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
   - **Non-Linear:** Data elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner.
     - **Tree**: A hierarchical structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.
     - **Graph**: A collection of nodes and edges, where edges can connect nodes in a variety of ways.

3. **Static vs Dynamic Data Structures**
   - **Static**: Fixed in size (e.g., arrays).
   - **Dynamic**: Can grow or shrink during runtime (e.g., linked lists, stacks, queues).

#### **Algorithms**
- **Definition:** An algorithm is a set of steps or rules to perform a task or solve a problem.

#### **Types of Algorithms:**

1. **Simple Recursive Algorithms**  
   - A process where the solution involves calling the same function with smaller inputs.
   - Example: **Sum of elements in an array** using recursion.

2. **Divide and Conquer Algorithms**  
   - The problem is divided into smaller sub-problems, which are solved recursively and then combined.
   - Example: **Quick Sort** and **Merge Sort**.

3. **Dynamic Programming Algorithms**  
   - Solves problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and storing the solutions to sub-problems to avoid redundant calculations (memoization).
   - Example: **Fibonacci sequence**, **Knapsack problem**.

4. **Greedy Algorithms**  
   - Makes the locally optimal choice at each step, hoping that these local optimals will lead to a global optimum solution.
   - Example: **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path, **Huffman Coding**.

5. **Brute Force Algorithms**  
   - A straightforward approach where all possible solutions are tried until a satisfactory one is found.
   - Example: **Linear Search**, **Bubble Sort**.

6. **Randomized Algorithms**  
   - Use randomization to make decisions during computation.
   - Example: **Randomized Quick Sort**.

2. **Shortest Path Algorithms** (e.g., Dijkstra’s Algorithm to find the shortest route on maps).
3. **Optimization Algorithms** (e.g., used to arrange solar panels on the International Space Station).

#### **What Makes a Good Algorithm?**
1. **Correctness:** The algorithm must provide the correct solution for all possible inputs.
2. **Efficiency:** The algorithm should minimize the use of resources, particularly time and space.
