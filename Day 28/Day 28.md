### What is a Binary Search Tree (BST)?
A **Binary Search Tree (BST)** is a specialized type of binary tree that adheres to the following properties:

1. **Node Structure**:
   - Each node has a key (value), a left child, and a right child.

2. **Ordering Property**:
   - For any node:
     - All keys in its left subtree are less than its key.
     - All keys in its right subtree are greater than its key.

3. **Uniqueness**:
   - Duplicate keys are typically not allowed in a BST.

### Why Do We Need a Binary Search Tree?
A Binary Search Tree is crucial in computer science for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. Key benefits include:

1. **Efficient Searching**:
   - BST allows for fast lookups in \(O(\log n)\) time on average due to its ordered structure.

2. **Dynamic Data**:
   - Unlike arrays, a BST dynamically adjusts to insertions and deletions without requiring memory reallocation.

3. **Ordered Data**:
   - A BST inherently maintains sorted order, making operations like finding the smallest or largest element simple.

4. **Versatility**:
   - Used in algorithms like tree sort, and as a backbone for other data structures like AVL trees and red-black trees.

### Basic Operations on BST

1. **Create a BST**:
   - A new BST starts as an empty tree. Nodes are added as needed.

2. **Insert a Node**:
   - Traverse the tree to find the correct position and insert the node while maintaining BST properties.

3. **Traverse a BST**:
   - Common traversal methods include:
     - **Inorder (Left, Root, Right)**: Retrieves elements in sorted order.
     - **Preorder (Root, Left, Right)**: Useful for creating a copy of the tree.
     - **Postorder (Left, Right, Root)**: Useful for deleting the tree.

4. **Search in BST**:
   - Start at the root and navigate left or right based on the value until the key is found or a null pointer is reached.

5. **Delete a Node**:
   - Three cases:
     - Node with no children: Directly remove it.
     - Node with one child: Replace the node with its child.
     - Node with two children: Replace with the in-order successor or predecessor.

6. **Delete the Entire BST**:
   - Recursively delete all nodes using post-order traversal.

### Time and Space Complexity of BST

| **Operation**      | **Best Case** | **Average Case** | **Worst Case** |
|---------------------|---------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Search**          | \(O(\log n)\) | \(O(\log n)\)    | \(O(n)\)       |
| **Insertion**       | \(O(\log n)\) | \(O(\log n)\)    | \(O(n)\)       |
| **Deletion**        | \(O(\log n)\) | \(O(\log n)\)    | \(O(n)\)       |
| **Space Complexity**| \(O(n)\)      | \(O(n)\)         | \(O(n)\)       |
