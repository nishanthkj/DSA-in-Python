### 1. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeTwoLists(l1, l2):
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy
    
    while l1 and l2:
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            current.next = l1
            l1 = l1.next
        else:
            current.next = l2
            l2 = l2.next
        current = current.next
    
    if l1:
        current.next = l1
    elif l2:
        current.next = l2
    
    return dummy.next
```

### 2. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List**
```python
def deleteDuplicates(head):
    current = head
    while current and current.next:
        if current.val == current.next.val:
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            current = current.next
    return head
```

### 3. **Remove Linked List Elements**
```python
def removeElements(head, val):
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    current = dummy
    
    while current and current.next:
        if current.next.val == val:
            current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            current = current.next
    
    return dummy.next
```

### 4. **Reverse Linked List**
```python
def reverseList(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    
    return prev
```

### 5. **Palindrome Linked List**
```python
def isPalindrome(head):
    # Find the middle of the linked list
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    # Reverse the second half of the list
    prev = None
    while slow:
        next_node = slow.next
        slow.next = prev
        prev = slow
        slow = next_node
    
    # Compare both halves
    left, right = head, prev
    while right:  # Only need to check the right half
        if left.val != right.val:
            return False
        left = left.next
        right = right.next
    
    return True
```

### 6. **Middle of the Linked List**
```python
def middleNode(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow
```

### Explanation of Solutions:
1. **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**: This function uses a dummy node to build the merged list, comparing the nodes from `l1` and `l2` one by one.
2. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Linked List**: As the list is already sorted, you only need to compare each node with the next one, removing the node if they have the same value.
3. **Remove Linked List Elements**: A dummy node is used to simplify edge cases (e.g., removing the head of the list). The list is traversed, and each node with the target value is skipped.
4. **Reverse Linked List**: This is done by iterating through the list and reversing the direction of the `next` pointers.
5. **Palindrome Linked List**: The approach involves finding the middle of the list, reversing the second half, and comparing both halves.
6. **Middle of the Linked List**: The slow and fast pointer technique is used to find the middle of the list in one pass.

### Example Usage:
```python
# Example for merging two sorted linked lists:
l1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(4)))
l2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4)))
merged = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2)
while merged:
    print(merged.val, end=" -> ")
    merged = merged.next
